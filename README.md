# NumPy Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
Implementation of an MLP using NumPy to classify the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset using mini-batch gradient descent on the CPU. This was an exercise to check my understanding of back propagation.

All code was written without AI assistance.

## Quick Start
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run training:
```bash
python ./train.py
```
